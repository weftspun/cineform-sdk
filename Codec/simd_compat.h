/*! @file simd_compat.h

	One include in place of <emmintrin.h>.

	On x86 this is <emmintrin.h> and nothing else, so that target is bit-for-bit
	what it was. On ARM it is sse2neon for the 128-bit surface, mmx2neon.h for the
	64-bit one, and a posix_memalign pair for the two allocator intrinsics that
	live in the same Intel header and are not vector operations at all.

	WHY A HEADER RATHER THAN A BUILD FLAG. The includes were unconditional in 27
	files. Guarding each one in place would put the same seven preprocessor lines
	in 27 places, and the next file added would be written from the pattern next
	to it -- unconditional again. One header is one place to be wrong.

	(C) 2026 -- Apache-2.0 OR MIT, matching the workspace.
